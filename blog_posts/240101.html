      <h2>Of Trees, Tigers and Turmoil</h2>
      <p><em>Published on January 31, 2024</em></p>
      <p>This story is from May 2023, when I first stepped foot on the mountains of the Western Ghats.</p>

      <p>I visited the Nilgiris for the first time to see and understand the landscape I’ll be working on for my thesis.  I took an overnight bus from Bangalore to Ooty. The ride was comfortable as much as it was expensive. I was coincidentally accompanied by none other than Mr Faizee Ali Khan, who was on the same path, but our destinations were different.  I was tired from packing and moving around the day before, so I slept the whole night on the bus, woke up around 5, and found the bus parked in nowhere. Apparently, we were waiting outside Bandipur National Park (BNP). Since the bus could not move inside at night, it had to wait until dawn. As the first sun rays hit the window glass, the bus started moving into the forest. It was a different landscape, far away from the significant buildings and busy roads of big cities where I had been for a long time. We spotted several Chitals, Peafowls and a few Elephants in the forest. All the elephants looked like they were part of a rehabilitation camp, but not wild. I had never seen wild Elephants yet and hoped this would be the first.</p>
      <p>The BNP turns into Madumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) as we cross into Tamil Nadu from Karnataka, but guess what? I see no other change than an extra stop and barricade. Out of the MTR, the bus finally started climbing uphill, juggling through hairpin roads all along the hill. We were climbing to the famous tourist town of Ooty; I had dreamed of visiting this place since I learned that people go faraway places for leisure. On the way to Ooty, the roadsides were filled with Eucalyptus trees, all non-native alien trees, part of plantation drives, either by the colonial foresters or the local forester departments until a few decades earlier. Eucalyptus trees are native to Australia, and their plantation has adversely changed the landscape and its ecology.
<br>My friend Faizee got down in the middle somewhere, I don’t know where, but it looked nice. When I finally reached Ooty with a dead phone, I had to pretend I drank coffee and stood at a small coffee shop near the bus stand. The kind owner allowed me to charge my phone at his shop, which saved me. It is funny how all life depends on a tiny device hated by all our life-givers - our mothers.</p>
      <p> All the hills visible from the bus stand at Ooty were also filled with tea estates and Eucalyptus plantations, which had gotten some kind of disease, perhaps cause they all had shed leaves and were only tree skeletons. The sight was not pleasing; it was not the heaven I imagined as a kid. On top of that was the curse of knowledge that I now bear that all these hills would have been only montane grasslands without the colonial foresters, which makes it more disappointing to see what it is like now. Still trying to discover public Auto-rickshaw prices, I walked a few kilometres to meet a brilliant scientist who allowed me to accompany her to Avalanche Forest Reserve and her field sites, around where I would work later. It had rained recently; mud was everywhere, and the roads were congested. It was not one of the best places to walk with luggage, but it was nothing I couldn’t manage.</p>
      <p>Finally, we departed from Ooty towards Avalanche, a town now famous on social media for its lake and forest safari. I saw several social media posts about the place before coming here. I would later discover that it's less of an attraction for what tourists come here for.</p>
      <p>The route to Avalanche was beautiful, with breathtaking scenery and small villages. On the same road, I better understood the plantations and invasions. It was everywhere! I stayed inside the Avalanche forest reserve at a field station, a small house with vast space and many facilities. Outside the station are enormous hills with mountainous grasslands on top. It was my first time looking at them, and it was beautiful. I had never seen something like this. The vast stretches of grasslands were occupied by dense dark green patches of forests in the mountain folds or valleys. These forests are called Shola forests here locally. Generally called a forest-grassland mosaic, this system is found globally in the tropics at high elevations. It is the most fantastic thing if you think about it.</p>
      <p>Around the field station, I saw my first western ghat endemic species, like the Indian Blackbird, Hill Swallow, Indian Brown Mongoose, and other high-altitude species, like the Grey-headed Canary Flycatcher. It was my first day here, and I was in awe of the landscape, the animals, the plants and the people.</p>
      <h3>Day 2 </h3>
      <p>Skiping to the following day, we were off to protected fragments of the native natural habitats. We drove to a site inside Avalanche Forest Reserve. The area is called Usimalai, the local highest peak with a small temple. The hill is all grassland, with a few patches of invasive shrubs here and there. The morning drive was chilly, even though it's May and supposed to be peak summers around places where I have lived so far. On the drive, the first town is called Lawrence (the one that says ‘Avilanji’ on Google Maps). We saw a painted bush Quail crossing the road with two chicks. Seeing it was a lovely morning treat. These birds are so beautiful, full of colour and patterns. Still, you never get to see them clearly cause they are so elusive and shy, and they have to be since they are ground-dwelling birds and can not fly away when danger arrives. The drive to Avalanche, crossing several towns, tea estates, and hills, was filled with beautiful scenery, with Jungle mynas chilling along the road. After reaching a certain point inside the reserve, we had to park the vehicle and climb the hill on foot. Walking beside a large patch of planted Pine trees, we saw evidence of animal presence: Tiger, Leopard, Elephant, Barking deer and Sambhar, and I saw Rhododendron trees up close for the first time.</p>

      <p>After a little walk up the hill, I saw a Shola forest up close, my first time observing the differences in the conditions inside and outside a Shola. The trees suddenly start in grassland, and it becomes much colder, more humid, and darker. I was baffled! Sitting under the Shola, I listened to many birds, but the dark branches didn't let me see anything except a female Nilgiri flycatcher, which I later identified with the help of my birding friends at IISER PT. Then, I took a nap. I can say for sure I had not napped so well in a really long time.</p>
      <p>But I was not here to see the Sholas. I was here to see the montane grasslands. The incredible, unique, beautiful habitat is now endangered due to alien trees. When I walked in the grassland, I thought it did not adhere directly to its name, that there were so many shrubs and wattle trees here and there. It didn’t look like what I had seen in pictures. I think that old Windows wallpaper had set a standard for what a grassland would be like, although I am unsure if what was in that picture was a grassland. Among all this, very luckily, I saw a pair of Nilgiri Pipits hanging around a frond of grasses, and I managed to get a picture in the nick of time. This bird is an endemic habitat specialist, meaning it only thrives in the grasslands of Nilgiris and other hill ranges of the Western Ghats. It is equally endangered as its habitat, the grasslands.
<br>Later, I also saw a Male Nilgiri flycatcher - which is another endemic bird - sitting on a Wattle tree in an invaded grassland patch, which led me to think about how the wildlife here is adapting (or adapted to) the novel habitats created by these alien trees.
</p>
      <h3> Day 3 </h3>
      <p> We woke up early the next day, ready to climb another hill. There was no driving that day; it was a much more exciting way to commute on foot. We started by crossing Avalanche Lake from the bridge at the powerhouse and walking into a shola forest. This Shola patch could have been more pleasant than it was. Its understory was thick, with barely any space to roam. Unlike the Sholas I saw yesterday, with mostly nothing in the understory. This patch was filled with invasive alien plants that grow under shola forests, primarily shrubs and bushes, comprising Cestrum aurantiacum, Solanum sp., Argentinum and Pteridium, to name a few. After the harsh and thick forest was crossed, we walked along a dried-up stream, slowly climbing the mountain. We walked through several grassland patches along the ridge, then moved into Eucalyptus plantations, which looked more horrible as we got closer. All this time climbing, I thought about how people 100 years ago climbed these mountains, planted so many trees, and worked so hard without thinking about any consequences? </p>
      <p>After climbing a little over a hundred metres, the plantation and invasive patches were not in sight. I could enjoy the heavy winds in the open grasslands while looking down at where we had come from. I once again became a child and started walking in and out of Shola forest patches repeatedly, and I was amazed every time. Like in the Marvel movies, it was like stepping into a portal that sends you into another universe. Inside the Shola patch, I saw a Nilgiri Sholakili nest, an inverted cone made of mosses, sitting in a small tree at about my neck's height. Later, a pair of Laughingthrushes came to check out what the humans were doing in their home, making loud sounds as they “laughed” at us.</p>
      <p>A few hours later, we climbed back as the sunset. Suddenly, it was very silent, and there were no bird sounds. We ran out of water and filled the bottle with running stream water. The water tasted good. I wonder if it was tasty or if I was too thirsty and imagining that. While returning, we found several butterfly wings, but not bodies, at the powerhouse. Some clever bird picks off toxic wings and eats only the nutritious body.</p>
      <p>This was the end of my Nilgiri trip. The next day, I had to return to Bangalore's bustling city by taking a bus from Emerald to Ooty and then another from Ooty to Bangalore. But this last day was not sad, as a Niligiri marten came to bid me farewell just outside the field station, hopping around here and there very fast. I could only get a glimpse of it. I would later realise how rare it is to spot a Marten.</p>
      <p>This was a thrilling adventure, and I would like to explore more places and find more wonderful creatures. Still, I am bound to the Nilgiris for a long time, and I will cherish all of it!</p>
